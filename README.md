# Mapping Environmental Racial Inequality in Texas

## Objective
Guided by the Texas Freedom Network, Climate Cabinet will provide data on race, income, and air pollution, creating a map of disparate impact from pollution in Texas. This mapping tool will help identify Texas communities that are most affected by pollution and that are vulnerable to pollutionâ€™s effects. It will be vital in increasing rates of awareness of climate change among the next generation of voters and policymakers in Texas.
